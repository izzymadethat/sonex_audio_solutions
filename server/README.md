# Basic Express.js Template

This template is a basic Express.js project template with some basic features and configurations. It includes:

- Basic project structure
- Basic Express.js configuration
- Initial route and controller
- Basic middleware
- Basic error handling
- Basic logging

It does **NOT** include:

- Database connectivity
- Authentication and authorization
- Testing
- Deployment
- Security best practices

## How to get the template

You will be able to get this template and set it up for any Express.js project. You can do this by copying the snippets below. This will create a brand new folder with the contents inside as clone does, but there is no git folder and it will be yours. Do not clone this repo directly, as you'll be directly modifying the template and won't be able to use it as a base for your own project.

## 1. Getting the project folder

### If you use SSH

```sh
npx tiged izzymadethat/express-basic#main <your_project_name>
```

### Via HTTPS:

```sh
npx tiged https://github.com/izzymadethat/express-basic <your_project_name>
```

## 2. Installing dependencies

if you are not already in the project folder...

```sh
cd <your_project_name>
```

Then run...

```sh
npm install

```

### 3. Running the project

- Write all of your logic and routes as you see fit.
- Logging, basic middleware, and the server configuration are already set up.

#### Running the server

In development mode:

```sh
npm run dev
```

in production/non-debugging mode:

```sh
npm start
```

### And that's it!
